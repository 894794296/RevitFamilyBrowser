# RevitFamilyBrowser
Browser for .rfa Revit family files
 This project is Revit AddIn. Works with Revit 2015, 2016 and Revit 2017. 
 It allows to see all types inside Revit family files (.rfa) from selected folder on disk 
 in dockable panel inside Revit without need to load them one by one. 
 By double click selected family type could be added inside project. 
 History tab collects all family Types from document to dockable panel and allows user to place them in project again. 
 History tab works with different documents simultaneously.
 To start work with addin you need to copy dll and zip file to specific folder:
 C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\2016 (or 2017 - if you use Revit 2017).
 Alternatively you can build source code in VisualStudio - all necessary files will be added in execution process.
